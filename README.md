This Cyber Safety Awareness Quiz is an interactive web-based tool designed to educate users on the fundamentals of digital security through a practical, hands-on assessment. Built using a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the application presents a series of five strategic questions that challenge the user's knowledge on essential topics like phishing, password hygiene, and online safety. What makes this project unique is its focus on immediate learning; if a user selects an incorrect answer, the quiz provides instant feedback explaining the "basics" behind the correct security practice. This ensures that the experience is not just a test, but an educational resource that helps build safer online habits in an engaging and accessible way.
